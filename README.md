### Running tests

There are two sets of tests:

1. Browser tests run with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io)
2. Node tests run with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

To run both the browser and Node tests:

- `npm run dev` to start local server.
- `npm run test`

To run just the browser tests with the Cypress UI:

- `npm run dev` to start local server
- `npm run test:browser`
or
- `npm run cypress` to view the Cypress UI

To run just the Node tests:

- `npm run test:node`


### Adding tests

- Update `cypress/test-pages/index.html` as needed or create a new test page if you need new examples.
- Add new tests in `cypress/integration/apis_spec.js`

### Making a new release

- Merge `dev` into `master`
- Pull down `master`
- Update version number in `src/color-thief.js` and `package.json`
- Run `npm run build`
- Commit and push built files back up to `master`
- Create a new Github release along with tag. Naming convention for both ```v2.8.1```
- `npm publish`
